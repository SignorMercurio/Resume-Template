# Resume Template

My personal resume template.

![Resume Template Demo](static/Template.jpg)

## Install the dependencies

Simply run `yarn` or `npm i`.

## Start the app in development mode

Quasar Dev Server has built-in hot-reloading enabled, so you don't have to worry about it:

```bash
quasar dev
```

## Build your own resume

1. Modify `src/components/config.ts`
2. Press `Command + P` (or `Ctrl + P`) in your browser
3. Enable background rendering
4. Scale the page until the format looks ok to you (for me, the scaling is usually about 57% - 60%)

If not, you may change `pages/Index.vue` and `layouts/MainLayout.vue` yourself.

To change the theme color, check out `css/quasar.variable.sass`.
